            <p>Alkamind engagements start by understanding the client within a developmental model of maturity. Every organism or organization evolved through generally distinct levels of maturity. When energy and skillful means are focused on the appropriate next steps through those developmental steps, the journey is both a fulfilling and rewarding one. Essentially you can not want to be a &quot;black belt&quot; level, you must become a &quot;black belt&quot; by transitional through the intermediate belts (appropriate next steps) to achieve the proficiency and realize the benefits from that level. Every environment is subject to evolutionary dynamics that reveal the underlying mystery of the challenges being faced. So, the first step is to establish an authentic origin story to understand how we got here. The we would extend that narrative into a reasonable trajectory of development as an orientation road map. Once we have our road map, then we create a portfolio of initiates that will propel us forward. This portfolio will then be used to select enabling projects to satisfy the portfolio based on essential actions to &quot;keep the system alive&quot;;, followed by actions that improve the &quot;health and viability of the system&quot;, to finally endeavour to achieve &quot;transformation and a new way of being&quot;. The Alkamind Way maps are provided where an Alkamind Moment uncovers the value proposition at the point of presence. In other words, you will start to believe when you start to experience that moment of clarity. That sometimes will take a bit of time, and we at Alkamind will take that time to work with you before you commit to what you want to undertake.</p>
